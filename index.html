    <h1>My Love,</h1>
    <p>My love, I genuinely canâ€™t be without you, I miss you so much, more than
        words could ever hold, I miss even the simplest things, like just
        talking to you, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing this, because I miss you, your
        voice, your presence, and even the silence we share, every part of you
        lingers in my heart like a melody I never want to stop hearing. Call me
        clingy, call me a crybaby if you want, but the truth is, Iâ€™m deeply,
        madly, and hopelessly in love with you, youâ€™re not just someone I love,
        youâ€™re my beautiful addiction, a soul I never want to unlearn, a
        presence I never want to live without, even the thought of being without
        you, it scares me more than anything else in this world. Even if we go
        just one day without talking, it feels like Iâ€™m being pulled into some
        kind of darkness, like today, it felt empty, like something within me
        was missing, maybe I feel too much, maybe I care too deeply, but Iâ€™m not
        trying to demand anything, I understand the situations, I just want you to know how much you truly
        mean to me. I donâ€™t compare us with anyone else, I never will, I donâ€™t
        care if some people feel relief when their girl doesnâ€™t talk to them for
        a while or takes a break, Iâ€™m not them, Iâ€™m me, and I canâ€™t, even if I
        have people around me, even if I have a hundred things to do, or a movie
        playing in front of me, my mind and my heart are still with you, always,
        only you. I miss being right beside you,
        seeing you, holding your hands, your smell, feeling your
        warmth, I miss the way your fingers would intertwine with mine, I miss
        the comfort of our hug, the soft calm of your voice, and yes, of
        course, I miss kissing you, that kiss, it's a blessing Iâ€™ll never take
        for granted. I just want this distance to end, I want to be near you
        again, to look at you, not through a screen, not through a memory, but
        in real, breathing, heart-thumping presence. Until that moment comes,
        just know this, I love you endlessly, and Iâ€™ll keep loving you with
        every beat my heart dares to give.
      </p>
